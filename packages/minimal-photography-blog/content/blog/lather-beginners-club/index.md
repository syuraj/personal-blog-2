Jump in for your first steps using a lathe, and get your certification. This group is for people completely new to wood-turning, and is a requirement for use of the lathe in the makerspace.

Perfect for Beginners, this class will introduce you to use of a wood lathe.
Get certified on our lathe and start making bowls, pens and all the round objects you desire!

Certification gives you access to use of the wood lathe during community nights. (Weds 5-10pm)
